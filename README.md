This demo uses the Okta Auth JS SDK (https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js) in a node.js application to demonstrate use cases such as Login, Logout, Password reset using Email OTP, Self service registration and Multifactor authentication

This was built for an internal buildathon focussed on showcasing the capabilities of the newly released Okta Identity Engine SDKs
